## 📝 Introduction
This project integrates **AI-based mask detection** with **IoT temperature sensing** to provide real-time monitoring. Using a transformer model for mask detection and Arduino for hardware interfacing, it offers an intelligent and interactive solution for safety and compliance.

---

## ✨ Features
- Real-time Mask Detection: Uses a Transformer model for high-accuracy mask detection.
- Temperature Monitoring: Measures temperature and proximity using DHT11 and ultrasonic sensors.
- LED Indicators: Provides feedback via LEDs based on the detection results.
- Seamless Integration: Bridges backend, frontend, and hardware for smooth communication.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
### Backend:
- FastAPI: For serving the mask detection API.
- Python: For ML model and API development.

### Frontend:
- React: For building an interactive user interface.

### Hardware:
- Arduino Uno: To handle temperature and mask detection inputs.
- DHT11 Sensor: For temperature and humidity sensing.
- Ultrasonic Sensor: For object proximity detection.

## 🔌 Hardware Components
1. Arduino Uno
2. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
3. Ultrasonic Sensor
4. ESP32/ESP8266 (optional for wireless communication)
5. LEDs (for visual indication)
6. Breadboard and Jumper Wires

- Arduino IDE for programming hardware

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mask-temperature-detection.git
cd mask-temperature-detection
```

---

### Backend Setup:
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

---

### Frontend Setup:

## 🐳 Docker Setup

### Prerequisites:
- Install Docker and Docker Compose.

### Build and Run the Containers:
1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Build the Docker images for backend and frontend:
   ```bash
   docker build -t backend ./backend
   docker build -t frontend ./frontend
   ```

3. Run the backend container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 backend
   ```

4. Run the frontend container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5173:5173 frontend
   ```

### Access the Application:
- Backend: Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser or use an API testing tool like Postman.
- Frontend: Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
